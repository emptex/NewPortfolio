The design process started really simple. I turn to just draw random triangle to compose the character while Silvia drawed a teddy bear kind of thing. 

The background story: There was a girl who smiles.
Updated background story:The girl turned herself into a teddy bear and can't smile anymore.

Reflection: The assignment is a a bit confusing and faced several dififulties. The collaboration did not work out well. So I decided to keep simple as possible. The concept of Exquisite Corpse worked bad when we had our last class online.
