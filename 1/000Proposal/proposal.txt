Introduction:
"Drizzle, Downpour and Storm" is a story about a story I wrote based on a family member's story. It was about a boy sent to a casino to pay off his father's debts. This game is a prologue, exploring a turning point in the protagonist's life. The rain symbolizes the struggles he cannot escape, and the game reflects this through both story and gameplay.

Concept and Gameplay:
The game aims to convey life's hardships and the resilience required to endure them. Players will control the protagonist as he tries to avoid raindrops, representing his attempts to escape his fate. By letting the raindrops flow away the protagonist slowly gathers his memory, revealing significant moments from his past, highlighting his family struggles and his father's downfall. The goal is to show that, despite his efforts, the protagonist inevitably becomes drenched by life's challenges.

Visual and Audio Design:
The simplistic, hard-edged art style will use muted tones to convey a melancholic atmosphere, with the rain changing in intensity to reflect the protagonist's emotions. A piano-driven soundtrack combined with rain sounds will create an immersive emotional experience, emphasizing the protagonist's internal struggle.
