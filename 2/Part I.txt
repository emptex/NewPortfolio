Brain storm:
1. show of sun pointing to a certain number （sundial）
2. stone errosion by water
3. star sky points to time

The point is use system time to generate greet base on different time of the day.

pseudocode:(i dont know the proper format of it i just try to make sense)

//stars

rotate(speed)
speed = speed+1
(set of random points)
//this create rotating stars

if mousePressed > time slow down
  Greet = "Good + xxx"
  
xxx = get.hour

if hour <xxx then output xxx
etc
